# Exceptions: The invalidArg Function (F#)

The **invalidArg** function generates an argument exception.


## CAPS_SYNTAX_MD



```


invalidArg parameter-name error-message-string


```



## CAPS_REMARKS_MD
The parameter-name in the previous syntax is a string with the name of the parameter whose argument was invalid. The *error-message-string* is a literal string or a value of type **string**. It becomes the **Message** property of the exception object.

The exception generated by **invalidArg** is a **System.ArgumentException** exception. The following code illustrates the use of **invalidArg** to throw an exception.



```



let months = [| "January"; "February"; "March"; "April";
                "May"; "June"; "July"; "August"; "September";
                "October"; "November"; "December" |]

let lookupMonth month =
   if (month > 12 || month < 1)
     then invalidArg "month" (sprintf "Value passed in was %d." month)
   months.[month - 1]

printfn "%s" (lookupMonth 12)
printfn "%s" (lookupMonth 1)
printfn "%s" (lookupMonth 13)


```



    The output is the following, followed by a stack trace (not shown).




```


December
January
System.ArgumentException: Month parameter out of range.


```
