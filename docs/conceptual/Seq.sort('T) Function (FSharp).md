## Remarks
This function returns a sequence that digests the whole initial sequence as soon as that sequence is iterated. As a result this function should not be used with large or infinite sequences. The function makes no assumption on the ordering of the original sequence. This is a stable sort, that is the original order of equal elements is preserved.

This function is named **Sort** in compiled assemblies. If you are accessing the function from a language other than F#, or through reflection, use this name.
